**User Roles**
- **Author**: Can draft new contracts from predefined templates, edit clauses, upload supporting documents, and send contracts for approval.
- **Approver**: Can review contracts and either approve or reject them with feedback.

- Parties Involved
- Effective Date

Version history and an audit trail of all changes will be maintained.

- Contract Name
- Parties
- Status
- Effective/Expiry Date

Finalized contracts can be exported as PDF documents.

**Authentication**
Simple email/password login for all users.

2. Dashboard (overview)
3. Contract List
4. Contract Detail & History
5. Contract Editor (drafting/editing)
